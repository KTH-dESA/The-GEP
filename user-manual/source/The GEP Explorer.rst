The GEP Explorer
============================

Role and Objective
******************************************

The **GEP “Explorer”** is an open access online platform that allows the user to interact with input data and electrification investment scenarios (EIS) of a specific country.  

More specifically, in the Base Data section of the **GEP “Explorer”** the user finds ‘easy to navigate’ maps that illustrate the country’s electrification status quo as well as data used to derive the electrification investment scenarios. In the form of “layers” these maps have been used in the electrification analysis of the annual GEP investment runs - but may also include other layers.

The latter explicitly presents how to achieve universal electricity access in two time steps. The first step is an outlook for a 5-year investment strategy. The second is ambitious full electrification by 2030. Further, the user is able to easily move through a number of scenario combinations within these two time-steps. The GEP “Explorer” is then rendering maps and results of the least-cost mix of off-, on- and mini-grid investments. Both are described in a little more detail below.

In the GEP “Explorer’s” Electrification Investment Scenario (EIS) section, the user can explore the results of pre-run and regularly updated electrification scenarios. These are derived from the annual GEP update. It is important to highlight that the user is not limited to the electrification investment maps generated within this project.

Target audience
-----------------------

The GEP “Explorer” can provide services for:

1. Rapid engagement with:
    * Internal WBG country briefing / Education (BBLs outreach to country officers)
    * High-level counterparts, consultants, financiers, partners, IGOs etc.
    * Providing investment outlook info for regular processes. Possible examples include the IEA WEO, WBG GTF, WBG SEAR, UN-HLPF, EMP-Africa, EMP-Asia Pacific etc.

2. Consolidating electrification base data and electrification investment scenarios for easy browsing, including the visualization of:
    * GIS layers used in the GEP scenarios as well additional layers related to electrification
    * Pre-cooked electrification investment scenarios / External electrification studies (tool independent) following internal QA/QC
