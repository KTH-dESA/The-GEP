The GEP Scenario Generator
==================================

Role and Objective
************************************

Training and outreach are key components of GEP. **GEP “Scenario Generator”** provides energy analysts with a tool to generate new electrification scenarios using an interactive interface. **GEP “Scenario Generator”** is an online interface of the Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool (`OnSSET.org <http://www.onsset.org/>`_). Here, analysts are able to replicate the GEP electrification investment scenarios available in **GEP “Explorer”**. They can also develop their own scenarios – and visualize them independently. This allows the analysts to build custom scenarios that better match local specificities or specific policy measures i.e. borrowing options, technology purchases, formulating concession programs, and subsidies.

**GEP “Scenario Generator”** can run locally on the user’s computer. Furthermore, integration into Google Earth Engine is currently being explored at various levels. As a starting point, input, intermediate, and result data that are compatible with the developed data guidelines – and will be “upload-able” into Earth Engine. This action will result in high levels of interoperability, ultimately allowing potentially fluid integration with other electrification models. That will help ensure that users and practitioners will be free to contribute to GEP without lock-in to a particular model.

The **GEP “Scenario Generator”** will enable the provision of specific key services:

1. Capacity building activities:
    a. Integrated into annual trainings: ICTP Global Summer School / Energy Modelling Platform(s) to provide a basic introduction to geo-spatial electrification training.
    b. Implemented in training and outreach with analysts in-country as part of new and ongoing electrification projects
    c. Become one of several key components in the OpTIMUS.community global Micro-Masters

2. Driver of development:
    a. Being cost-free, it enables both WBG or other projects to develop first order electrification plans (and EIS’s) rapidly at a drastically reduced cost.
    b. Providing counter-parts with the ability to move beyond pre-cooked results provided in GEP “Explorer” to more nuanced scenarios. Scenarios that are flexible to conditional national constraints for goals: developing detailed policy, engaging with financiers, exploring technology deployment and market potentials etc.
    c. Provide a tool that key partners such as UNDP, UNDESA, IAEA, GIZ, WRI and others can use for detailed country engagement.
